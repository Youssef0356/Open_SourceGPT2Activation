Managed to fine tune an open source ai bot called gpt 2 , the process first is by installing required libraries such as transformers and the gpt2 model 
firstly you need to run the prepare data file you need to write the data as json file , in my case i used random mall informations and prepared it , now i got a folder called tokanized data , now i have to run fine tune script now i can fine tune my model using that data but
it is not powerful sinse the data is not big and the model itself is not trained perfectly
finally you can test the model by hosting it using the hosting file or testing the model by testing model file .
